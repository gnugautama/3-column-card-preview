## My process

### Built with

- Bootstrap

### What I learned

```css
.container {
  padding: 5em;
}

.img_banner {
  width: 70px;
  height: auto;
  margin-top: 50px;
  margin-left: 50px;
}

.card-body {
  margin-left: 39px;
  margin-right: 39px;
```

### Continued development

I still not able to make the card more slimer. So I will continue to search on how to resolve it.

### Useful resources
